# Stack, Queue, and Sorting Operations in C++

This repository contains C++ code that demonstrates implementations of stack, queue, and sorting operations.

## Stack Class

The `Stack` class provides basic stack operations:

- **push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **pop**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **isFull**: Checks if the stack is full.
- **count**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- **peek**: Returns the element at a specified position.
- **change**: Modifies the element at a specified position.
- **display**: Displays all elements in the stack.

## Queue Class

The `Queue` class implements basic queue operations:

- **enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- **dequeue**: Removes and returns the front element of the queue.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
- **isFull**: Checks if the queue is full.
- **count**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
- **display**: Displays all elements in the queue.

## Sorting Operations

The code includes a `bubbleSort` function for sorting an array of integers. It also provides a function `SortOperation` to take user input for sorting.

## Usage

To use this code:
1. **Compile** the code using a C++ compiler:
2. **Run** the executable:
   
## Main Menu

Upon running, the program presents a main menu where you can choose between stack operations, queue operations, sorting, or exit:

- **Stack Operations**: Perform operations like push, pop, peek, etc., on a stack.
- **Queue Operations**: Perform operations like enqueue, dequeue, etc., on a queue.
- **Sorting**: Sort elements using bubble sort.
- **Exit**: Terminate the program.
